# Forecasting

The price ML forecasting project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict the future prices of assets, commodities, or products. This project involves collecting historical price data, along with relevant features such as market trends, economic indicators, and external factors that influence prices. Machine learning models are then trained on this data to learn patterns and relationships, enabling them to make accurate predictions of future price movements. These forecasts can be invaluable for financial decision-making, risk management, and strategic planning in various industries such as finance, retail, and manufacturing. The goal of the project is to develop a reliable forecasting system that can provide actionable insights to stakeholders, helping them make informed decisions based on anticipated price trends.
